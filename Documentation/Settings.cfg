description = This extension provides a frontend plugin which
      shows a list of files and folders in a specified directory
      on the file system (comparable to Apache directory listing)
      or using more advanced FAL selectors (categories, collection
      of files, ...). This extension may also be used for creating
      image galleries. Default templates are Bootstrap-ready.
