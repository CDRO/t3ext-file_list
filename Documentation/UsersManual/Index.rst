Configuration

   :alt: Configuration options
   :align: center
   :class: with-border with-shadow

.. note::

   The path will always be checked against any configured "root" (please read
   :ref:`TypoScript configuration <ts-plugin-tx-filelist-filelist-root>`),
   allowing the plugin to be used in a multi-site installation without risking
   an editor from showing files from another website.
